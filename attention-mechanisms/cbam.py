""" 
PyTorch implementation of CBAM: Convolutional Block Attention Module

As described in https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.06521

The attention mechanism is achieved by using two different types of attention gates: 
channel-wise attention and spatial attention. The channel-wise attention gate is applied 
to each channel of the input feature map, and it allows the network to focus on the most 
important channels based on their spatial relationships. The spatial attention gate is applied 
to the entire input feature map, and it allows the network to focus on the most important regions 
of the image based on their channel relationships.
